## Adding your SwiftUI Component

To add your SwiftUI Component to the project, you need to:

1. Create a new folder with the name of the Component and place it inside the directory `Sources/AcademyUI`. 

2. Place your .swift files related to the component inside the folder you just created.

Remember: in order for the package to see it, at least your component's main View struct should be `public`.
